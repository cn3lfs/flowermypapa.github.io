        <h1 id="Eloquent-JavaScript"><a href="#Eloquent-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Eloquent JavaScript"></a>Eloquent JavaScript</h1><h2 id="Array"><a href="#Array" class="headerlink" title="Array"></a>Array</h2><p>Fortunately, JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an array and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.</p>
<p>let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];</p>
<p>console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);<br>// → 5<br>console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);<br>// → 2<br>console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);<br>// → 3</p>
<p>The notation for getting at the elements inside an array also uses square brackets. A pair of square brackets immediately after an expression, with another expression inside of them, will look up the element in the left-hand expression that corresponds to the index given by the expression in the brackets.</p>
<p>The first index of an array is zero, not one. So the first element is retrieved with listOfNumbers[0]. Zero-based counting has a long tradition in technology and in certain ways makes a lot of sense, but it takes some getting used to. Think of the index as the amount of items to skip, counting from the start of the array.</p>
<h2 id="PROPERTIES"><a href="#PROPERTIES" class="headerlink" title="PROPERTIES"></a>PROPERTIES</h2><p>访问null, undefined会报typeerror 错误<br>Almost all JavaScript values have properties. The exceptions are null and undefined. If you try to access a property on one of these nonvalues, you get an error.</p>
<p>null.length;<br>// → TypeError: null has no properties</p>
<p>用点访问, 后面必须直接是literal property name, 用”[]”访问, 先evaluate[]里面的值, 让后再用里面的值访问property, 通常如果property name超过一个 word或者是数字, 我们会用这种方法.<br>The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. Both value.x and value[x] access a property on value—but not necessarily the same property. The difference is in how x is interpreted. When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name. Whereas value.x fetches the property of value named “x”, value[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result, converted to a string, as the property name.</p>
<p>So if you know that the property you are interested in is called color, you say value.color. If you want to extract the property named by the value held in the binding i, you say value[i]. Property names are strings. They can be any string, but the dot notation works only with names that look like valid binding names. So if you want to access a property named 2 or John Doe, you must use square brackets: value[2] or value[“John Doe”].</p>
<p>The elements in an array are stored as the array’s properties, using numbers as property names. Because you can’t use the dot notation with numbers and usually want to use a binding that holds the index anyway, you have to use the bracket notation to get at them.</p>
<h2 id="Methods"><a href="#Methods" class="headerlink" title="Methods"></a>Methods</h2><p>Both string and array objects contain, in addition to the length property, a number of properties that hold function values.</p>
<p>Properties that contain functions are generally called methods of the value they belong to, as in “toUpperCase is a method of a string”.</p>
<p>比如String有 toUpperCase, toLowerCase<br>Array 的 push, pop</p>
<p>Array用的是Stack数据结构, 后进先出<br>The push method adds values to the end of an array, and the pop method does the opposite, removing the last value in the array and returning it.</p>
<p>These somewhat silly names are the traditional terms for operations on a stack. A stack, in programming, is a data structure that allows you to push values into it and pop them out again in the opposite order so that the thing that was added last is removed first. These are common in programming—you might remember the function call stack from the previous chapter, which is an instance of the same idea.</p>
<h2 id="Objects"><a href="#Objects" class="headerlink" title="Objects"></a>Objects</h2><p>Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties. One way to create an object is by using braces as an expression.</p>
<p>let day1 = {<br>  squirrel: false,<br>  events: [“work”, “touched tree”, “pizza”, “running”]<br>};</p>
<p>用{}定义一个Object, 如果property name 不是变量命名或数字, 必须加””.<br>Inside the braces, there is a list of properties separated by commas. Each property has a name followed by a colon and a value. When an object is written over multiple lines, indenting it like in the example helps with readability. Properties whose names aren’t valid binding names or valid numbers have to be quoted.</p>
<p>This means that braces have two meanings in JavaScript. At the start of a statement, they start a block of statements. In any other position, they describe an object. Fortunately, it is rarely useful to start a statement with an object in braces, so the ambiguity between these two is not much of a problem.</p>
<p>访问不存在的property会得到undefined<br>Reading a property that doesn’t exist will give you the value undefined.</p>
<p>不同的binding 和 property 可以对应同一个东西<br>To briefly return to our tentacle model of bindings—property bindings are similar. They grasp values, but other bindings and properties might be holding onto those same values. You may think of objects as octopuses with any number of tentacles, each of which has a name tattooed on it.</p>
<p>The delete operator cuts off a tentacle from such an octopus. It is a unary operator that, when applied to an object property, will remove the named property from the object. This is not a common thing to do, but it is possible.</p>

<p>赋值undefined 和 delete他有什么区别?<br>The binary in operator, when applied to a string and an object, tells you whether that object has a property with that name. The difference between setting a property to undefined and actually deleting it is that, in the first case, the object still has the property (it just doesn’t have a very interesting value), whereas in the second case the property is no longer present and in will return false.</p>
<p>Object.keys:<br>To find out what properties an object has, you can use the Object.keys function. You give it an object, and it returns an array of strings—the object’s property names.</p>
<p>console.log(Object.keys({x: 0, y: 0, z: 2}));<br>// → [“x”, “y”, “z”]</p>
<p>Object.assign:<br>There’s an Object.assign function that copies all properties from one object into another.</p>
<p>let objectA = {a: 1, b: 2};<br>Object.assign(objectA, {b: 3, c: 4});<br>console.log(objectA);<br>// → {a: 1, b: 3, c: 4}</p>
<p>Arrays, then, are just a kind of object specialized for storing sequences of things. If you evaluate typeof [], it produces “object”. You can see them as long, flat octopuses with all their tentacles in a neat row, labeled with numbers.</p>
<h2 id="Mutability"><a href="#Mutability" class="headerlink" title="Mutability"></a>Mutability</h2><p>literal values are immutable<br>We saw that object values can be modified. The types of values discussed in earlier chapters, such as numbers, strings, and Booleans, are all immutable—it is impossible to change values of those types. You can combine them and derive new values from them, but when you take a specific string value, that value will always remain the same. The text inside it cannot be changed. If you have a string that contains “cat”, it is not possible for other code to change a character in your string to make it spell “rat”.</p>
<p>Objects work differently. You can change their properties, causing a single object value to have different content at different times.</p>
<p>对于两个一样的 literal value, 如果他们相同就是完全相同, 而对于两个 Object, 如果他们的binding不是reference to同一个Object, 则即便他们有相同的property 和 value, 那他们也是两个东西<br>When we have two numbers, 120 and 120, we can consider them precisely the same number, whether or not they refer to the same physical bits. With objects, there is a difference between having two references to the same object and having two different objects that contain the same properties. </p>

<p>bing可以通过改变指针指向不同的值, 但是就一个单纯的值来说, 他是不可改变的; const定义的binding指针不可改变, 但是指针指向的Object里面的内容可以改变.<br>Bindings can also be changeable or constant, but this is separate from the way their values behave. Even though number values don’t change, you can use a let binding to keep track of a changing number by changing the value the binding points at. Similarly, though a const binding to an object can itself not be changed and will continue to point at the same object, the contents of that object might change.</p>

<p>用==进行比较,  两个不同的Object, 即便他们里面的内容一样, 那他们也不会相等, js本身没有built-in的深度比较<br>When you compare objects with JavaScript’s == operator, it compares by identity: it will produce true only if both objects are precisely the same value. Comparing different objects will return false, even if they have identical properties. There is no “deep” comparison operation built into JavaScript, which compares objects by contents, but it is possible to write it yourself (which is one of the exercises at the end of this chapter).</p>
<h2 id="The-lycanthrope’s-log"><a href="#The-lycanthrope’s-log" class="headerlink" title="The lycanthrope’s log"></a>The lycanthrope’s log</h2><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> journal = [];</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">addEntry</span>(<span class="params">events, squirrel</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  journal.push(&#123;events, squirrel&#125;);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// equal to journal.push(&#123;events: events, squirrel: squirrel&#125;);</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Note that the object added to the journal looks a little odd. Instead of declaring properties like events: events, it just gives a property name. This is shorthand that means the same thing—if a property name in brace notation isn’t followed by a value, its value is taken from the binding with the same name.</p>

        <h1 id="Eloquent-JavaScript"><a href="#Eloquent-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Eloquent JavaScript"></a>Eloquent JavaScript</h1><p>Function是我们用来减少重复代码的一种包装好的东西, 让我们可以反复使用, 减少程序的复杂性<br>The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p>
<p>这里采用ES2015标准定义函数<br>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number:</p>
<p>const square = function(x) {<br>  return x * x;<br>};</p>
<p>A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword function. Functions have a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and a body, which contains the statements that are to be executed when the function is called. The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in braces, even when it consists of only a single statement.</p>
<p>A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all.</p>
<p>return会立即跳出当前的Function, 并将指定的值返回给调用它的地方, 如果没有指定返回值, 会返回undefined.<br>Some functions produce a value, such as power and square, and some don’t, such as makeNoise, whose only result is a side effect. A return statement determines the value the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function. A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined. Functions that don’t have a return statement at all, such as makeNoise, similarly return undefined.<br>Parameters to a function behave like regular bindings, but their initial values are given by the caller of the function, not the code in the function itself.</p>
<h2 id="Bindings-and-scopes"><a href="#Bindings-and-scopes" class="headerlink" title="Bindings and scopes"></a>Bindings and scopes</h2><p>这里讲的是this<br>Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the binding is visible. For bindings defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole program—you can refer to such bindings wherever you want. These are called global.</p>
<p>local scope:<br>But bindings created for function parameters or declared inside a function can be referenced only in that function, so they are known as local bindings. Every time the function is called, new instances of these bindings are created. This provides some isolation between functions—each function call acts in its own little world (its local environment) and can often be understood without knowing a lot about what’s going on in the global environment.</p>
<p>ES2015的block scope与之前的function scope的区别, block scope比如for loop, 在loop前面以及loop后面的东西都不能访问loop里面的变量, 而function scope是你只要在function内, 我就可以随意访问, 只有function 才可以创建新的scope<br>Bindings declared with let and const are in fact local to the block that they are declared in, so if you create one of those inside of a loop, the code before and after the loop cannot “see” it. In pre-2015 JavaScript, only functions created new scopes, so old-style bindings, created with the var keyword, are visible throughout the whole function that they appear in—or throughout the global scope, if they are not in a function.</p>
<p>变量mask<br>Each scope can “look out” into the scope around it, so x is visible inside the block in the example. The exception is when multiple bindings have the same name—in that case, code can see only the innermost one.</p>
<h2 id="Nested-scope"><a href="#Nested-scope" class="headerlink" title="Nested scope"></a>Nested scope</h2><p>function或block里面可以再放function以及block<br>JavaScript distinguishes not just global and local bindings. Blocks and functions can be created inside other blocks and functions, producing multiple degrees of locality.</p>
<p>里面的function可以看见外面function的变量, 反过来不行<br>The code inside the ingredient function can see the factor binding from the outer function. But its local bindings, such as unit or ingredientAmount, are not visible in the outer function.</p>
<p>lexical scope:<br>The set of bindings visible inside a block is determined by the place of that block in the program text. Each local scope can also see all the local scopes that contain it, and all scopes can see the global scope. This approach to binding visibility is called lexical scoping.</p>
<h2 id="Functions-as-values"><a href="#Functions-as-values" class="headerlink" title="Functions as values"></a>Functions as values</h2><p>function identifier 同样也是一个变量, 拥有变量所有的所有特性, 可以再次被赋值, 如果不是用const定义的话, 然后function本身是一个值, 拥有值得所有特性, 可以被用作expression, 所以可以用在另一个function里面, 当成参数, 这就是callback.<br>A function binding usually simply acts as a name for a specific piece of the program. Such a binding is defined once and never changed. This makes it easy to confuse the function and its name.</p>
<p>But the two are different. A function value can do all the things that other values can do—you can use it in arbitrary expressions, not just call it. It is possible to store a function value in a new binding, pass it as an argument to a function, and so on. Similarly, a binding that holds a function is still just a regular binding and can, if not constant, be assigned a new value, like so:</p>
<p>let launchMissiles = function() {<br>  missileSystem.launch(“now”);<br>};<br>if (safeMode) {<br>  launchMissiles = function() {};<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Declaration-notation"><a href="#Declaration-notation" class="headerlink" title="Declaration notation"></a>Declaration notation</h2><p>There is a slightly shorter way to create a function binding. When the function keyword is used at the start of a statement, it works differently.</p>
<p>function square(x) {<br>  return x * x;<br>}</p>
<p>This is a function declaration. The statement defines the binding square and points it at the given function. It is slightly easier to write and doesn’t require a semicolon after the function.</p>
<p>function hoisting:<br>There is one subtlety with this form of function definition.</p>
<p>console.log(“The future says:”, future());</p>
<p>function future() {<br>  return “You’ll never have flying cars”;<br>}</p>
<p>The preceding code works, even though the function is defined below the code that uses it. Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope. This is sometimes useful because it offers the freedom to order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying about having to define all functions before they are used.</p>
<h2 id="Arrow-functions"><a href="#Arrow-functions" class="headerlink" title="Arrow functions"></a>Arrow functions</h2><p>There’s a third notation for functions, which looks very different from the others. Instead of the function keyword, it uses an arrow (=&gt;) made up of an equal sign and a greater-than character (not to be confused with the greater-than-or-equal operator, which is written &gt;=).</p>
<p>const power = (base, exponent) =&gt; {<br>  let result = 1;<br>  for (let count = 0; count &lt; exponent; count++) {<br>    result *= base;<br>  }<br>  return result;<br>};</p>
<p>The arrow comes after the list of parameters and is followed by the function’s body. It expresses something like “this input (the parameters) produces this result (the body)”.</p>
<p>When there is only one parameter name, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter list. If the body is a single expression, rather than a block in braces, that expression will be returned from the function. So, these two definitions of square do the same thing:</p>
<p>const square1 = (x) =&gt; { return x <em> x; };<br>const square2 = x =&gt; x </em> x;</p>
<p>When an arrow function has no parameters at all, its parameter list is just an empty set of parentheses.</p>
<p>const horn = () =&gt; {<br>  console.log(“Toot”);<br>};</p>
<h2 id="The-call-stack"><a href="#The-call-stack" class="headerlink" title="The call stack"></a>The call stack</h2><p>stack是常见的数据结构, 后进后出<br>The way control flows through functions is somewhat involved. Because a function has to jump back to the place that called it when it returns, the computer must remember the context from which the call happened. In one case, console.log has to return to the greet function when it is done. In the other case, it returns to the end of the program.</p>
<p>每次function执行完, 需要返回到调用它的地方, 因此需要记住那个地方—context, 每次执行完就会移除最顶层的 call stack.<br>The place where the computer stores this context is the call stack. Every time a function is called, the current context is stored on top of this stack. When a function returns, it removes the top context from the stack and uses that context to continue execution.</p>
<p>过多次使用stack会导致内存不足报错, 比如多次recursion<br>Storing this stack requires space in the computer’s memory. When the stack grows too big, the computer will fail with a message like “out of stack space” or “too much recursion”. The following code illustrates this by asking the computer a really hard question that causes an infinite back-and-forth between two functions. Rather, it would be infinite, if the computer had an infinite stack. As it is, we will run out of space, or “blow the stack”.</p>
<h2 id="Optional-Arguments"><a href="#Optional-Arguments" class="headerlink" title="Optional Arguments"></a>Optional Arguments</h2><p>js里面可以传递多个参数, 当传递进去的参数少于必须参数时, 不够的参数会用undefined补充, 从而可以使你的Function更加灵活, 你可以对这些undefined的参数做判断, 从而实现某些额外的功能<br>The following code is allowed and executes without any problem:</p>
<pre><code>function square(x) { return x * x; }
console.log(square(4, true, &quot;hedgehog&quot;));
</code></pre><p>We defined square with only one parameter. Yet when we call it with three, the language doesn’t complain. It ignores the extra arguments and computes the square of the first one.</p>
<p>JavaScript is extremely broad-minded about the number of arguments you pass to a function. If you pass too many, the extra ones are ignored. If you pass too few, the missing parameters get assigned the value undefined.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that it is possible—likely, even—that you’ll accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments to functions. And no one will tell you about it.</p>
<p>The upside is that this behavior can be used to allow a function to be called with different numbers of arguments. For example, this minus function tries to imitate the - operator by acting on either one or two arguments:</p>
<pre><code>function minus(a, b) {
  if (b === undefined) return -a;
  else return a - b;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="Closure"><a href="#Closure" class="headerlink" title="Closure"></a>Closure</h2><p>The ability to treat functions as values, combined with the fact that local bindings are re-created every time a function is called, brings up an interesting question. What happens to local bindings when the function call that created them is no longer active?</p>
<p>The following code shows an example of this. It defines a function, wrapValue, that creates a local binding. It then returns a function that accesses and returns this local binding.</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">wrapValue</span>(<span class="params">n</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">let</span> local = n;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> local;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> wrap1 = wrapValue(<span class="number">1</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> wrap2 = wrapValue(<span class="number">2</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(wrap1());</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(wrap2());</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>每次调用function, 都要重新生成lcoal binding, 每次的都不一样<br>This is allowed and works as you’d hope—both instances of the binding can still be accessed. This situation is a good demonstration of the fact that local bindings are created anew for every call, and different calls can’t trample on one another’s local bindings.</p>
<p>closure就是可以访问enclosing scope 里面的 lcoal binds 的instance, 也就是一个function可以访问它的enclosing scope里面的 local bindings.<br>This feature—being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope—is called closure. A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure. This behavior not only frees you from having to worry about lifetimes of bindings but also makes it possible to use function values in some creative ways.</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">multiplier</span>(<span class="params">factor</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function"><span class="params">number</span> =&gt;</span> number * factor;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> twice = multiplier(<span class="number">2</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(twice(<span class="number">5</span>));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>参数本身就是 local binding<br>The explicit local binding from the wrapValue example isn’t really needed since a parameter is itself a local binding.</p>
<p>把function分成两部分, 一部分是code本身, 另一部分是创建他们的environment, 当调用他们的时候, 他们的context 是创建他们的 environment, 而不是执行的地方的 environment<br>Thinking about programs like this takes some practice. A good mental model is to think of function values as containing both the code in their body and the environment in which they are created. When called, the function body sees the environment in which it was created, not the environment in which it is called.</p>
<p>In the example, multiplier is called and creates an environment in which its factor parameter is bound to 2. The function value it returns, which is stored in twice, remembers this environment. So when that is called, it multiplies its argument by 2.</p>
<h2 id="Recursion"><a href="#Recursion" class="headerlink" title="Recursion"></a>Recursion</h2><p>It is perfectly okay for a function to call itself, as long as it doesn’t do it so often that it overflows the stack. A function that calls itself is called recursive. Recursion allows some functions to be written in a different style. Take, for example, this alternative implementation of power:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">power</span>(<span class="params">base, exponent</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (exponent == <span class="number">0</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> base * power(base, exponent - <span class="number">1</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(power(<span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>使用起来会让整个程序看起来更加简洁, 但是缺点是会比for loop要慢上3倍<br>This is rather close to the way mathematicians define exponentiation and arguably describes the concept more clearly than the looping variant. The function calls itself multiple times with ever smaller exponents to achieve the repeated multiplication.</p>
<p>But this implementation has one problem: in typical JavaScript implementations, it’s about three times slower than the looping version. Running through a simple loop is generally cheaper than calling a function multiple times.</p>
<p>是否使用recursion 更像是在机器语言之间和人类语言之间取得一个平衡, 并不是任何时候都以效率为先的, 特别是当一些问题已经特别复杂的时候, 再去考虑这些只会让问题变得更难解决, recursion 在对待多次分支的问题上比较有优势. 当效率确实成为了我们程序的瓶颈时候, 我们再去优化程序也不迟.<br>The dilemma of speed versus elegance is an interesting one. You can see it as a kind of continuum between human-friendliness and machine-friendliness. Almost any program can be made faster by making it bigger and more convoluted. The programmer has to decide on an appropriate balance.</p>
<p>In the case of the power function, the inelegant (looping) version is still fairly simple and easy to read. It doesn’t make much sense to replace it with the recursive version. Often, though, a program deals with such complex concepts that giving up some efficiency in order to make the program more straightforward is helpful.</p>
<p>Worrying about efficiency can be a distraction. It’s yet another factor that complicates program design, and when you’re doing something that’s already difficult, that extra thing to worry about can be paralyzing.</p>
<p>Recursion is not always just an inefficient alternative to looping. Some problems really are easier to solve with recursion than with loops. Most often these are problems that require exploring or processing several “branches”, each of which might branch out again into even more branches.</p>
<p>Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite set of numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produces that number?</p>
<p>For example, the number 13 could be reached by first multiplying by 3 and then adding 5 twice, whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at all.</p>

<h2 id="Growing-functions"><a href="#Growing-functions" class="headerlink" title="Growing functions"></a>Growing functions</h2><p>There are two more or less natural ways for functions to be introduced into programs.</p>
<p>发现代码重复了, 不想每次都写那么多, 所以写个function, 每次要用的时候import, 调用一下<br>The first is that you find yourself writing similar code multiple times. You’d prefer not to do that. Having more code means more space for mistakes to hide and more material to read for people trying to understand the program. So you take the repeated functionality, find a good name for it, and put it into a function.</p>
<p>觉得这个功能值得为他写个function, 先写出来再说<br>The second way is that you find you need some functionality that you haven’t written yet and that sounds like it deserves its own function. You’ll start by naming the function, and then you’ll write its body. You might even start writing code that uses the function before you actually define the function itself.</p>
<p>function naming意味着你对这个问题理解有多深<br>How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good indication of how clear a concept it is that you’re trying to wrap. </p>
<p>We want to write a program that prints two numbers: the numbers of cows and chickens on a farm, with the words Cows and Chickens after them and zeros padded before both numbers so that they are always three digits long.</p>
<p>007 Cows<br>011 Chickens</p>
<p>This asks for a function of two arguments—the number of cows and the number of chickens.

<p>让一个function仅仅执行它本身的功能, 不要给一个function赋予太多功能, 这样可以降低你的程序之间的dependency.<br>It works! But that name, printZeroPaddedWithLabel, is a little awkward. It conflates three things—printing, zero-padding, and adding a label—into a single function.</p>
<p>Instead of lifting out the repeated part of our program wholesale, let’s try to pick out a single concept.</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">zeroPad</span>(<span class="params">number, width</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">let</span> string = <span class="built_in">String</span>(number);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">while</span> (string.length &lt; width) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    string = <span class="string">"0"</span> + string;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> string;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">printFarmInventory</span>(<span class="params">cows, chickens, pigs</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">`<span class="subst">$&#123;zeroPad(cows, <span class="number">3</span>)&#125;</span> Cows`</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">`<span class="subst">$&#123;zeroPad(chickens, <span class="number">3</span>)&#125;</span> Chickens`</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">`<span class="subst">$&#123;zeroPad(pigs, <span class="number">3</span>)&#125;</span> Pigs`</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">printFarmInventory(<span class="number">7</span>, <span class="number">16</span>, <span class="number">3</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>确实需要的功能才加, 不要可能需要就加, 这样能保持你的程序简洁<br>A useful principle is to not add cleverness unless you are absolutely sure you’re going to need it. It can be tempting to write general “frameworks” for every bit of functionality you come across. Resist that urge. You won’t get any real work done—you’ll just be writing code that you never use.</p>
<h2 id="Functions-and-side-effects"><a href="#Functions-and-side-effects" class="headerlink" title="Functions and side effects"></a>Functions and side effects</h2><p>function有的只返回一个值, 有的还会一些其他作用, function 被 call之后会改变程序的一部分, 对于那些只返回值的并且自己自足的, 我们称之为pure function. 他不依赖 global bindings, 每次给一样的参数返回的都是一样的结果, 并且调用它的地方可以用它的一个返回值代替.<br>Functions can be roughly divided into those that are called for their side effects and those that are called for their return value. (Though it is definitely also possible to both have side effects and return a value.)</p>
<p>The first helper function in the farm example, printZeroPaddedWithLabel, is called for its side effect: it prints a line. The second version, zeroPad, is called for its return value. It is no coincidence that the second is useful in more situations than the first. Functions that create values are easier to combine in new ways than functions that directly perform side effects.</p>
<p>A pure function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only has no side effects but also doesn’t rely on side effects from other code—for example, it doesn’t read global bindings whose value might change. A pure function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces the same value (and doesn’t do anything else). A call to such a function can be substituted by its return value without changing the meaning of the code. When you are not sure that a pure function is working correctly, you can test it by simply calling it and know that if it works in that context, it will work in any context. Nonpure functions tend to require more scaffolding to test.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>函数定义的三种方式</p>
<p>const f = function(a) {<br>    console.log(a + 2);<br>}</p>
<p>function g(a) {<br>    console.log(a + 2);<br>}</p>
<p>let h = a =&gt; a + 2;</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>let const对应的是block scope, var 对应的是function scope 或 global scope<br>A key aspect in understanding functions is understanding scopes. Each block creates a new scope. Parameters and bindings declared in a given scope are local and not visible from the outside. Bindings declared with var behave differently—they end up in the nearest function scope or the global scope.</p>
<p>Separating the tasks your program performs into different functions is helpful. You won’t have to repeat yourself as much, and functions can help organize a program by grouping code into pieces that do specific things.</p>

        <h1 id="Eloquent-JavaScript"><a href="#Eloquent-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Eloquent JavaScript"></a>Eloquent JavaScript</h1><h2 id="Expressions-and-statements"><a href="#Expressions-and-statements" class="headerlink" title="Expressions and statements"></a>Expressions and statements</h2><p>A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or “psychoanalysis”) is an expression. An expression between parentheses is also an expression, as is a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one.Expressions can contain other expressions in a way similar to how subsentences in human languages are nested—a subsentence can contain its own subsentences, and so on. </p>
<p>A statement stands on its own, so it amounts to something only if it affects the world. It could display something on the screen—that counts as changing the world—or it could change the internal state of the machine in a way that will affect the statements that come after it. These changes are called side effects. </p>
<p>In some cases, JavaScript allows you to omit the semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has to be there, or the next line will be treated as part of the same statement. The rules for when it can be safely omitted are somewhat complex and error-prone.</p>
<h2 id="Bindings—Define-a-variable"><a href="#Bindings—Define-a-variable" class="headerlink" title="Bindings—Define a variable"></a>Bindings—Define a variable</h2><p> To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a binding, or variable:<br> let caught = 5 * 5;</p>
<p>That’s a second kind of statement. The special word (keyword) let indicates that this sentence is going to define a binding. It is followed by the name of the binding and, if we want to immediately give it a value, by an = operator and an expression.</p>
<p>The previous statement creates a binding called caught and uses it to grab hold of the number that is produced by multiplying 5 by 5.</p>
<p>After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression. The value of such an expression is the value the binding currently holds.</p>
<h3 id="variable-reference"><a href="#variable-reference" class="headerlink" title="variable reference:"></a>variable reference:</h3><p>When a binding points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to that value forever. The = operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one.You should imagine bindings as tentacles, rather than boxes. They do not contain values; they grasp them—two bindings can refer to the same value. A program can access only the values that it still has a reference to. When you need to remember something, you grow a tentacle to hold on to it or you reattach one of your existing tentacles to it.</p>
<h3 id="undefined"><a href="#undefined" class="headerlink" title="undefined"></a>undefined</h3><p>定义时未赋值:<br>When you define a binding without giving it a value, the tentacle has nothing to grasp, so it ends in thin air. If you ask for the value of an empty binding, you’ll get the value undefined</p>
<h3 id="let-const-var"><a href="#let-const-var" class="headerlink" title="let const var"></a>let const var</h3><p>A single let statement may define multiple bindings. The definitions must be separated by commas.<br>    let one = 1, two = 2;</p>
<p>The words var and const can also be used to create bindings, in a way similar to let.</p>
<pre><code>var name = &quot;Ayda&quot;;
const greeting = &quot;Hello &quot;;
</code></pre><p>The first, var (short for “variable”), is the way bindings were declared in pre-2015 JavaScript.</p>
<p>The word const stands for constant. It defines a constant binding, which points at the same value for as long as it lives. This is useful for bindings that give a name to a value so that you can easily refer to it later.</p>
<h2 id="Binding-names"><a href="#Binding-names" class="headerlink" title="Binding names"></a>Binding names</h2><p>不能以数字开头, 可以有$ _ 字母:<br>Binding names can be any word. Digits can be part of binding names—catch22 is a valid name, for example—but the name must not start with a digit. A binding name may include dollar signs ($) or underscores (_) but no other punctuation or special characters.</p>
<p>Words with a special meaning, such as let, are keywords, and they may not be used as binding names. There are also a number of words that are “reserved for use” in future versions of JavaScript, which also can’t be used as binding names. The full list of keywords and reserved words is rather long.</p>
<h2 id="The-environment"><a href="#The-environment" class="headerlink" title="The environment"></a>The environment</h2><p>The collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time is called the environment. When a program starts up, this environment is not empty. It always contains bindings that are part of the language standard, and most of the time, it also has bindings that provide ways to interact with the surrounding system.</p>
<p>比如一些DOM操作, 还是一些浏览器暴露的api</p>
<h2 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h2><p>A lot of the values provided in the default environment have the type function. A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value. Such values can be applied in order to run the wrapped program.</p>
<p>Executing a function is called invoking, calling, or applying it. You can call a function by putting parentheses after an expression that produces a function value. Usually you’ll directly use the name of the binding that holds the function. The values between the parentheses are given to the program inside the function. Values given to functions are called arguments. Different functions might need a different number or different types of arguments.</p>
<h2 id="The-console-log-function"><a href="#The-console-log-function" class="headerlink" title="The console.log function"></a>The console.log function</h2><p>In the examples, I used console.log to output values. Most JavaScript systems (including all modern web browsers and Node.js) provide a console.log function that writes out its arguments to some text output device. </p>
<h2 id="Return-values"><a href="#Return-values" class="headerlink" title="Return values"></a>Return values</h2><p>Showing a dialog box or writing text to the screen is a side effect. A lot of functions are useful because of the side effects they produce. Functions may also produce values, in which case they don’t need to have a side effect to be useful.<br>When a function produces a value, it is said to return that value. Anything that produces a value is an expression in JavaScript, which means function calls can be used within larger expressions.</p>
<h2 id="Control-flow"><a href="#Control-flow" class="headerlink" title="Control flow"></a>Control flow</h2><p>执行顺序, 自上而下, 一般是在stack<br>When your program contains more than one statement, the statements are executed as if they are a story, from top to bottom. </p>
<h2 id="Conditional-execution"><a href="#Conditional-execution" class="headerlink" title="Conditional execution"></a>Conditional execution</h2><p>if else:<br>Not all programs are straight roads. We may, for example, want to create a branching road, where the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand. This is called conditional execution.<br>Conditional execution is created with the if keyword in JavaScript. In the simple case, we want some code to be executed if, and only if, a certain condition holds. </p>
<p>The statement after the if is wrapped in braces ({ and }) in this example. The braces can be used to group any number of statements into a single statement, called a block. You could also have omitted them in this case, since they hold only a single statement, but to avoid having to think about whether they are needed, most JavaScript programmers use them in every wrapped statement like this. </p>
<p>You often won’t just have code that executes when a condition holds true, but also code that handles the other case. This alternate path is represented by the second arrow in the diagram. You can use the else keyword, together with if, to create two separate, alternative execution paths. If you have more than two paths to choose from, you can “chain” multiple if/else pairs together.</p>
<h2 id="while-and-do-loops"><a href="#while-and-do-loops" class="headerlink" title="while and do loops"></a>while and do loops</h2><p>That works, but the idea of writing a program is to make something less work, not more. If we needed all even numbers less than 1,000, this approach would be unworkable. What we need is a way to run a piece of code multiple times. This form of control flow is called a loop.Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeat it with our current program state. </p>
<p>只要条件为真, 就一直执行, 先判断, 再执行<br>while loop:<br>A statement starting with the keyword while creates a loop. The word while is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement, much like if. The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the expression produces a value that gives true when converted to Boolean.</p>
<p>至少执行一次,先执行后判断<br>do while loop:<br>A do loop is a control structure similar to a while loop. It differs only on one point: a do loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing whether it should stop only after that first execution. To reflect this, the test appears after the body of the loop.</p>
<h2 id="Indenting-Code"><a href="#Indenting-Code" class="headerlink" title="Indenting Code"></a>Indenting Code</h2><p>良好的缩进保持代码整洁:<br>In the examples, I’ve been adding spaces in front of statements that are part of some larger statement. These spaces are not required—the computer will accept the program just fine without them. In fact, even the line breaks in programs are optional. You could write a program as a single long line if you felt like it.</p>
<p>The role of this indentation inside blocks is to make the structure of the code stand out. In code where new blocks are opened inside other blocks, it can become hard to see where one block ends and another begins. With proper indentation, the visual shape of a program corresponds to the shape of the blocks inside it. </p>
<h2 id="for-loops"><a href="#for-loops" class="headerlink" title="for loops"></a>for loops</h2><p>Many loops follow the pattern shown in the while examples. First a “counter” binding is created to track the progress of the loop. Then comes a while loop, usually with a test expression that checks whether the counter has reached its end value. At the end of the loop body, the counter is updated to track progress.</p>
<p>Because this pattern is so common, JavaScript and similar languages provide a slightly shorter and more comprehensive form, the for loop.<br>The parentheses after a for keyword must contain two semicolons. The part before the first semicolon initializes the loop, usually by defining a binding. The second part is the expression that checks whether the loop must continue. The final part updates the state of the loop after every iteration. In most cases, this is shorter and clearer than a while construct.</p>
<h2 id="Breaking-Out-of-a-Loop"><a href="#Breaking-Out-of-a-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Breaking Out of a Loop"></a>Breaking Out of a Loop</h2><p>Having the looping condition produce false is not the only way a loop can finish. There is a special statement called break that has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.</p>
<p>是否可以被某个数字整除<br>Using the remainder (%) operator is an easy way to test whether a number is divisible by another number. If it is, the remainder of their division is zero.</p>
<p>无限循环<br>The for construct in the example does not have a part that checks for the end of the loop. This means that the loop will never stop unless the break statement inside is executed.f you were to remove that break statement or you accidentally write an end condition that always produces true, your program would get stuck in an infinite loop. A program stuck in an infinite loop will never finish running, which is usually a bad thing.</p>
<p>直接结束这一轮, 跳到下一轮<br>The continue keyword is similar to break, in that it influences the progress of a loop. When continue is encountered in a loop body, control jumps out of the body and continues with the loop’s next iteration.</p>
<h2 id="Updating-bindings-succinctly"><a href="#Updating-bindings-succinctly" class="headerlink" title="Updating bindings succinctly"></a>Updating bindings succinctly</h2><p>Especially when looping, a program often needs to “update” a binding to hold a value based on that binding’s previous value.</p>
<p>counter = counter + 1;</p>
<p>JavaScript provides a shortcut for this.</p>
<p>counter += 1;</p>
<p>Similar shortcuts work for many other operators, such as result *= 2 to double result or counter -= 1 to count downward.<br>For counter += 1 and counter -= 1, there are even shorter equivalents: counter++ and counter–</p>
<h2 id="Dispatching-on-a-value-with-switch"><a href="#Dispatching-on-a-value-with-switch" class="headerlink" title="Dispatching on a value with switch"></a>Dispatching on a value with switch</h2><p>There is a construct called switch that is intended to express such a “dispatch” in a more direct way. Unfortunately, the syntax JavaScript uses for this (which it inherited from the C/Java line of programming languages) is somewhat awkward—a chain of if statements may look better.</p>
<p>忘记break会使程序继续执行下去, 触发多个选项<br>You may put any number of case labels inside the block opened by switch. The program will start executing at the label that corresponds to the value that switch was given, or at default if no matching value is found. It will continue executing, even across other labels, until it reaches a break statement. But be careful—it is easy to forget such a break, which will cause the program to execute code you do not want executed.</p>
<h2 id="Capitalization"><a href="#Capitalization" class="headerlink" title="Capitalization"></a>Capitalization</h2><p>Binding names may not contain spaces, yet it is often helpful to use multiple words to clearly describe what the binding represents.<br>The first style can be hard to read. I rather like the look of the underscores, though that style is a little painful to type. The standard JavaScript functions, and most JavaScript programmers, follow the bottom style—they capitalize every word except the first. It is not hard to get used to little things like that, and code with mixed naming styles can be jarring to read, so we follow this convention</p>
<h2 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h2><p>多注释<br>Often, raw code does not convey all the information you want a program to convey to human readers, or it conveys it in such a cryptic way that people might not understand it. At other times, you might just want to include some related thoughts as part of your program. This is what comments are for.</p>
<p>A comment is a piece of text that is part of a program but is completely ignored by the computer. JavaScript has two ways of writing comments. To write a single-line comment, you can use two slash characters (//) and then the comment text after it.</p>

        <h2 id="XPath"><a href="#XPath" class="headerlink" title="XPath"></a>XPath</h2><p>XPath stands for XML Path Language. It uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an XML document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not.</p>
<p>XPath is mainly used in XSLT, but can also be used as a much more powerful way of navigating through the DOM of any XML-like language document using XPathExpression, such as HTML and SVG, instead of relying on the Document.getElementById() or ParentNode.querySelectorAll() methods, the Node.childNodes properties, and other DOM Core features.</p>
<p>XPath uses a path notation (as in URLs) for navigating through the hierarchical structure of an XML document. It uses a non-XML syntax so that it can be used in URIs and XML attribute values.</p>
<h2 id="Location-Path-Expression"><a href="#Location-Path-Expression" class="headerlink" title="Location Path Expression"></a>Location Path Expression</h2><p>A location path can be absolute or relative.</p>
<p>An absolute location path starts with a slash ( / ) and a relative location path does not. In both cases the location path consists of one or more steps, each separated by a slash:</p>
<p>An absolute location path:</p>
<p>/step/step/…</p>
<p>A relative location path:</p>
<p>step/step/…</p>
<p>Each step is evaluated against the nodes in the current node-set.</p>
<p>A step consists of:</p>
<p>an axis (defines the tree-relationship between the selected nodes and the current node)<br>a node-test (identifies a node within an axis)<br>zero or more predicates (to further refine the selected node-set)</p>
<p>The syntax for a location step is:<br>axisname::nodetest[predicate] </p>
<h2 id="XSLT"><a href="#XSLT" class="headerlink" title="XSLT"></a>XSLT</h2><p>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is an XML-based language used, in conjunction with specialized processing software, for the transformation of XML documents.</p>
<p>Although the process is referred to as “transformation,” the original document is not changed; rather, a new XML document is created based on the content of an existing document. Then, the new document may be serialized (output) by the processor in standard XML syntax or in another format, such as HTML or plain text.</p>
<p>XSLT is most often used to convert data between different XML schemas or to convert XML data into web pages or PDF documents. [one]</p>

<p>JSON 文件里面是用来配置小程序的，这也是非常熟悉的，但是里面只能用双引号，跟package.json有点类似。</p>
<h2 id="wxml"><a href="#wxml" class="headerlink" title="wxml"></a>wxml</h2><p>wxml 里面标签必须要严格闭合，否则会报错。<br>WXML中的属性是大小写敏感的。</p>
<h3 id="数据绑定"><a href="#数据绑定" class="headerlink" title="数据绑定"></a>数据绑定</h3><p>小程序里面的数据绑定跟Vue有点类似<br> 对应 data 里面的 var<br>but 区分大小写<br>没有被定义的变量的或者是被设置为 undefined 的变量不会被同步到 wxml 中{}里面可以放简单的 expression</p>
<h3 id="Conditional-Rendering"><a href="#Conditional-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Conditional Rendering"></a>Conditional Rendering</h3><p>类似 Vue 有 v-if v-else-if -v-else ，小程序里面有 wx:if wx:elif wx:else<br>同样 vue 切换多个对象在template 上处理，小程序用block</p>
<h3 id="List-Rendering"><a href="#List-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="List Rendering"></a>List Rendering</h3><p>Vue: v-for=”item in items” :key=”item.id”     小程序: wx:for=”“</p>
<p>注意小程序中默认每个元素就是item 索引是 index<br>使用 wx:for-item 指定数组当前元素的变量名，使用 wx:for-index 指定数组当前下标的变量名</p>
<p>类似 block wx:if ，也可以将 wx:for 用在 <block>标签上，以渲染一个包含多节点的结构块</block></p>
<p>如果列表中项目的位置会动态改变或者有新的项目添加到列表中，并且希望列表中的项目保持自己的特征和状态（如 <input> 中的输入内容， <switch> 的选中状态），需要使用 wx:key 来指定列表中项目的唯一的标识符。</switch></p>
<p>wx:key 的值以两种形式提供：</p>
<pre><code>字符串，代表在 for 循环的 array 中 item 的某个 property，该 property 的值需要是列表中唯一的字符串或数字，且不能动态改变。这里直接就是写成wx:key=&quot;property&quot;而不是wx:key=&quot;item.property&quot;

保留关键字 this 代表在 for 循环中的 item 本身，这种表示需要 item 本身是一个唯一的字符串或者数字，如：
</code></pre><p>当数据改变触发渲染层重新渲染的时候，会校正带有 key 的组件，框架会确保他们被重新排序，而不是重新创建，以确保使组件保持自身的状态，并且提高列表渲染时的效率。</p>
<p>这跟Vue 里面的 Patch 模式有点类似,key提供给Vue用于追踪每个element,使得这个过程可以充分reuse existing elements.</p>
<h3 id="template"><a href="#template" class="headerlink" title="template"></a>template</h3><p>WXML提供模板（template），可以在模板中定义代码片段，然后在不同的地方调用。使用 name 属性，作为模板的名字。然后在 <template> 内定义代码片段，使用 is 属性，声明需要的使用的模板，然后将模板所需要的 data 传入.is里面加一个tenary逻辑判断,可以动态决定具体需要渲染哪个模板.</template></p>
<h3 id="import-and-include"><a href="#import-and-include" class="headerlink" title="import and include"></a>import and include</h3><p>WXML 提供两种文件引用方式import和include。</p>
<p>需要注意的是 import 有作用域的概念，即只会 import 目标文件中定义的 template，而不会 import 目标文件中 import 的 template，简言之就是 import 不具有递归的特性。<br>include 可以将目标文件中除了template外的整个代码引入，相当于是拷贝到 include 位置.</p>
<h3 id="public-attr"><a href="#public-attr" class="headerlink" title="public attr"></a>public attr</h3><p>表2-1 共同属性<br>属性名     类型  描述  注解<br>id  String  组件的唯一标识     整个页面唯一<br>class   String  组件的样式类  在对应的 WXSS 中定义的样式类<br>style   String  组件的内联样式     可以动态设置的内联样式<br>hidden  Boolean     组件是否显示  所有组件默认显示<br>data-<em>  Any     自定义属性   组件上触发的事件时，会发送给事件处理函数<br>bind</em>/catch*    EventHandler    组件的事件</p>

<p>A Job is an abstract operation that initiates an ECMAScript computation when no other ECMAScript computation is currently in progress. A Job abstract operation may be defined to accept an arbitrary set of job parameters.</p>
<p>Execution of a Job can be initiated only when there is no running execution context and the execution context stack is empty. A PendingJob is a request for the future execution of a Job. A PendingJob is an internal Record whose fields are specified in Table 24. Once execution of a Job is initiated, the Job always executes to completion. No other Job may be initiated until the currently running Job completes. However, the currently running Job or external events may cause the enqueuing of additional PendingJobs that may be initiated sometime after completion of the currently running Job.</p>

<p><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tasks, microtasks, queues and schedules</a><br>To understand this you need to know how the event loop handles tasks and microtasks. This can be a lot to get your head around the first time you encounter it. Deep breath…</p>
<p>Each ‘thread’ gets its own event loop, so each web worker gets its own, so it can execute independently, whereas all windows on the same origin share an event loop as they can synchronously communicate. The event loop runs continually, executing any tasks queued. An event loop has multiple task sources which guarantees execution order within that source (specs such as IndexedDB define their own), but the browser gets to pick which source to take a task from on each turn of the loop. This allows the browser to give preference to performance sensitive tasks such as user-input. Ok ok, stay with me…</p>
<p>Tasks are scheduled so the browser can get from its internals into JavaScript/DOM land and ensures these actions happen sequentially. Between tasks, the browser may render updates. Getting from a mouse click to an event callback requires scheduling a task, as does parsing HTML, and in the above example, setTimeout.</p>
<p>setTimeout waits for a given delay then schedules a new task for its callback. This is why setTimeout is logged after script end, as logging script end is part of the first task, and setTimeout is logged in a separate task. Right, we’re almost through this, but I need you to stay strong for this next bit…</p>
<p>Microtasks are usually scheduled for things that should happen straight after the currently executing script, such as reacting to a batch of actions, or to make something async without taking the penalty of a whole new task. The microtask queue is processed after callbacks as long as no other JavaScript is mid-execution, and at the end of each task. Any additional microtasks queued during microtasks are added to the end of the queue and also processed. Microtasks include mutation observer callbacks, and as in the above example, promise callbacks.</p>
<p>Once a promise settles, or if it has already settled, it queues a microtask for its reactionary callbacks. This ensures promise callbacks are async even if the promise has already settled. So calling .then(yey, nay) against a settled promise immediately queues a microtask. This is why promise1 and promise2 are logged after script end, as the currently running script must finish before microtasks are handled. promise1 and promise2 are logged before setTimeout, as microtasks always happen before the next task.</p>
<p>So, step by step:<br><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'script start'</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">setTimeout(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'setTimeout'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;, <span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">Promise</span>.resolve().then(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'promise1'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;).then(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'promise2'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<pre><code>Tasks execute in order, and the browser may render between them
Microtasks execute in order, and are executed:
    after every callback, as long as no other JavaScript is mid-execution
    at the end of each task

<h3 id="WHAT-IS-SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY"><a href="#WHAT-IS-SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY" class="headerlink" title="WHAT IS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY?"></a>WHAT IS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY?</h3><p>Social psychology is a science that studies the influences of our situations, with special attention to how we view and affect one another. More precisely, it is the scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another ( Figure 1.1 ).</p>
<p>Social psychology lies at psychology’s boundary with sociology. </p>
<p>Compared with sociology (the study of people in groups and societies), social psychology focuses more on individuals and does more experimentation.</p>
<p>Compared with personality psychology, social psychology focuses less on individuals’ differences and more on how individuals, in general, view and affect one another</p>

You and I may react differently to a situation because we think differently.</p>

<p>Thinking, memory, and attitudes all operate on two levels—one conscious and deliberate, the other unconscious and automatic. Today’s researchers call it “dual processing.” </p>
<p>We know more than we know we know. We think on two levels—“intuitive” and “deliberate” (Kruglanski &amp; Gigerenzer, 2011).</p>
<p>Even our intuitions about ourselves often err. We intuitively trust our memories more than we should. </p>
<p>In most situations, “fast and frugal” snap judgments serve us well. But in others, in which accuracy matters—such as when needing to fear the right things and spend our resources accordingly—we had best restrain our impulsive intuitions with critical thinking. </p>

The answer to that question is quite straightforward. Psychological  research has immediate and crucial applications to important issues of eve- ryday experience: your physical and mental health, your ability to form and sustain close relationships, and your capacity for learning and personal growth. One of the foremost goals of Psychology and Life is to highlight the personal relevance   and social significance of psychological  expertise. </p>
<p>The challenge of introductory psychology is to bring the products of scientific research to bear on questions that matter to you.</p>
<p>We will inquire about the how, what, when, and why of human behavior and about the causes and consequences of behaviors you observe in yourself, in other people, and in animals. We will consider why you think, feel, and behave as you do. What makes you uniquely different from all other people? Yet why do you often behave so much like others? Are you molded by heredity, or are you shaped more by personal experiences? How can aggression and altruism, love and hate, and mental illness and creativity exist side by side in this complex creature—the human animal? In this opening chapter, we ponder how and why all these types of questions have become relevant to psychology’s goals as a discipline.</p>
<h3 id="WHAT-MAKES-PSYCHOLOGY-UNIQUE"><a href="#WHAT-MAKES-PSYCHOLOGY-UNIQUE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT MAKES PSYCHOLOGY UNIQUE?"></a>WHAT MAKES PSYCHOLOGY UNIQUE?</h3><h4 id="Definition"><a href="#Definition" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a>Definition</h4><p>Many psychologists seek answers to this fundamental question: What is human nature? Psychology answers this question by looking at processes that occur within individuals as well as forces that arise within the physical and social environment. In this light, we’ll define psychology as the scientific study of the behavior of individuals and their mental processes. Let’s explore the critical parts of this definition: scientific, behavior, individual, and mental </p>
<h5 id="scientific"><a href="#scientific" class="headerlink" title="scientific"></a>scientific</h5><p>The scientific aspect of psychology requires that psychological conclusions be based on evidence collected according to the principles of the scientific method. The scientific method consists of a set of orderly steps used to analyze and solve problems. This method uses objectively collected information as the factual basis for drawing conclusions.  </p>
<h5 id="Behavior"><a href="#Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Behavior"></a>Behavior</h5><p>Behavior is the means by which organisms adjust to their environment. Behavior is action. The subject matter of psychology largely consists of the observable behavior of humans and other species of animals. Smiling, crying, running, hitting, talking, and touching are some obvious examples of behavior you can observe. Psychologists examine what the individual does and how the individual goes about doing it within a given behavioral setting and in the broader social or cultural context </p>
<h5 id="Individual"><a href="#Individual" class="headerlink" title="Individual"></a>Individual</h5><p>The subject of psychological analysis is most often an individual. An individual might be studied in its natural habitat or in the controlled conditions of a research laboratory</p>
<h5 id="Mental"><a href="#Mental" class="headerlink" title="Mental"></a>Mental</h5><p>Many researchers in psychology also recognize that they cannot understand human actions without also understanding mental processes, the workings of the human mind. Much human activity takes place as private, internal events—thinking, planning, reasoning, creating, and dreaming. Many psychologists believe that mental processes represent the most important aspect of psychological inquiry.</p>
<p>The combination of these concerns defines psychology as a unique field. Within the social sciences, psychologists focus largely on the behavior of individuals in various settings, whereas sociologists study social behavior of groups or institutions, and anthropologists focus on the broader context of behavior in different cultures. Even so, psychologists draw broadly from the insights of other scholars.     </p>
<p>psychology The scientific study of the behavior of individuals and their mental processes. </p>
<p>scientific method The set of procedures used for gathering and interpreting objective information in a way that minimizes error and yields dependable generalizations. </p>
<p>behavior The actions by which an organism adjusts to its environment     </p>
<p>The best way to learn about the field is to learn to share psychologists’ goals. Let’s consider those goals.</p>
<h4 id="The-Goals-of-Psychology"><a href="#The-Goals-of-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="The Goals of Psychology"></a>The Goals of Psychology</h4><p>The goals of the psychologist conducting basic research are to describe, explain, predict, and control behavior. These goals form the basis of the psychological enterprise. </p>
<h5 id="Describing-What-Happens"><a href="#Describing-What-Happens" class="headerlink" title="Describing What Happens"></a>Describing What Happens</h5><p>The first task in psychology is to make accurate observations about behavior. Psychologists typically refer to such observations as their data (data is the plural, datum the singular). Behavioral data are reports of observations about the behavior of organisms and the conditions under which the behavior occurs. When researchers undertake data collection, they must choose an appropriate level of analysis and devise measures of behavior that ensure objectivity.</p>
<p>To investigate an individual’s behavior, researchers may use different levels of analysis—from the broadest, most global level down to the most minute, specific level. </p>
<p>Suppose, for example, you were trying to describe a painting you saw at a museum (see Figure 1.1 on page 4). At a global level, you might describe it by title, Bathers, and by artist, Georges Seurat. At a more specific level, you might recount features of the painting: Some people are sunning themselves on a riverbank while others are enjoying the water, and so on. At a very specific level, you might describe the technique Seurat used—tiny points of paint—to create the scene. The description at each level would answer different questions about the painting.</p>
<p>Different levels of psychological description also address different questions.Each level of analysis yields information essential to the final composite portrait of human nature that psychologists hope ultimately to develop.</p>
<h5 id="Explaining-What-Happens"><a href="#Explaining-What-Happens" class="headerlink" title="Explaining What Happens"></a>Explaining What Happens</h5><p>hereas descriptions must stick to perceivable information, explanations deliberately go beyond what can be observed. In many areas of psychology, the central goal is to find regular patterns in behavioral and mental processes. Psychologists want to discover how behavior works.      </p>
<p>Explanations in psychology usually recognize that most behavior is influenced by a combination of factors.       </p>
<p>Often a psychologist’s goal is to explain a wide variety of behavior in terms of one underlying cause.         </p>
<p>To forge such causal explanations, researchers must often engage in a creative process of examining a diverse collection of data. Master detective Sherlock Holmes drew shrewd conclusions from scraps of evidence.  </p>
<p>In a similar fashion, every researcher must use an informed imagination, which creatively synthesizes what is known and what is not yet known. A welltrained psychologist can explain observations by using her or his insight into the human experience along with the facts previous researchers have uncovered about the phenomenon in question. Much psychological research is an attempt to give accurate explanations for different behavioral patterns.</p>
<h5 id="Predicting-What-Will-Happen"><a href="#Predicting-What-Will-Happen" class="headerlink" title="Predicting What Will Happen"></a>Predicting What Will Happen</h5><p>Predictions in psychology are statements about the likelihood that a certain behavior will occur or that a given relationship will be found. Often an accurate explanation of the causes underlying some form of behavior will allow a researcher to make accurate predictions about future behavior. </p>
<p>When different explanations are put forward to account for some behavior or relationship, they are usually judged by how well they can make accurate and comprehensive predictions.</p>
<p>Just as observations must be made objectively, scientific predictions must be worded precisely enough to enable them to be tested and then rejected if the evidence does not support them. </p>
<p>To improve future predictions, a researcher would create systematic variations in environmental conditions and observe their influence on the baby’s response.</p>
<h5 id="Controlling-What-Happens"><a href="#Controlling-What-Happens" class="headerlink" title="Controlling What Happens"></a>Controlling What Happens</h5><p>For many psychologists, control is the central, most powerful goal. Control means making behavior happen or not happen—starting it, maintaining it, stopping it, and influencing its form, strength, or rate of occurrence. A causal explanation of behavior is convincing if it can create conditions under which the behavior can be controlled.        </p>
<p>The ability to control behavior is important because it gives psychologists ways of helping people improve the quality of their lives. </p>
<p>In this respect, psychologists are a rather optimistic group; many believe that virtually any undesired behavior pattern can be modified by the proper intervention. Psychology and Life shares that optimism.       </p>
<h3 id="THE-EVOLUTION-OF-MODERN-PSYCHOLOGY"><a href="#THE-EVOLUTION-OF-MODERN-PSYCHOLOGY" class="headerlink" title="THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY"></a>THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY</h3><p>At the core of this historical review is one simple principle: Ideas matter. Much of the history of psychology has been characterized by heated debates about what constitutes the appropriate subject matter and methodologies for a science of mind and behavior.      </p>
<p>This historical review will be carried out at two levels of analysis. The first section will consider the period of history in which some of the critical groundwork for modern psychology was laid down. This focus will enable you to witness at close range the battle of ideas. The second section will describe in a broader fashion seven perspectives that have emerged in the modern day.</p>
<h4 id="Psychology’s-Historical-Foundations"><a href="#Psychology’s-Historical-Foundations" class="headerlink" title="Psychology’s Historical Foundations"></a>Psychology’s Historical Foundations</h4><h5 id="Structuralism-The-Elements-of-the-Mind"><a href="#Structuralism-The-Elements-of-the-Mind" class="headerlink" title="Structuralism: The Elements of the Mind"></a>Structuralism: The Elements of the Mind</h5><p>Psychology’s potential to make a unique contribution to knowledge became apparent when psychology became a laboratory science organized around experiments. </p>
<p>Titchener’s goal was to uncover the underlying structure of the human mind by defining the component elements of an individual’s mental life. In fact, he conceived his research program in analogy to the work of chemists (1910, p. 49): “The psychologist arranges the mental elements precisely as the chemist classifies his elementary substances.” Titchener’s approach came to be known as structuralism, the study of the basic structural components of mind and behavior.</p>
<h5 id="Functionalism-Minds-With-a-Purpose"><a href="#Functionalism-Minds-With-a-Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Functionalism: Minds With a Purpose"></a>Functionalism: Minds With a Purpose</h5><p>William James agreed with Titchener that consciousness was central to the study of psychology. However, James focused his attention not on the elements of mental processes, but on their purpose. James wished to understand the ways in which consciousness functions to help people adapt effectively to their environments. James’s approach became known as functionalism.</p>
<p>structuralism: The study of the structure of mind and behavior; the view that all human mental experience can be understood as a combination of simple elements or events. </p>
<p>introspection: Individuals’ systematic examination of their own thoughts and feelings. </p>
<p>Gestalt psychology: A school of psychology that maintains that psychological phenomena can be understood only when viewed as organized, structured wholes, not when broken down into primitive perceptual elements. </p>
<p>functionalism: The perspective on mind and behavior that focuses on the<br>examination of their functions in an organism’s interactions with the environment.</p>
<p>John Dewey focused on the functions of reflexes, which he described as “a continuously ordered sequence of acts, all adapted in themselves and in the order of their sequence, to reach a certain objective end, the reproduction of the species, the preservation of life, locomotion to a certain place” (1896, p. 366). Dewey’s concern for the practical uses of mental processes led to important advances in education. His theorizing provided the impetus for progressive education in his own laboratory school and more generally in the United States        </p>
<h5 id="The-Legacy-of-These-Approaches"><a href="#The-Legacy-of-These-Approaches" class="headerlink" title="The Legacy of These Approaches"></a>The Legacy of These Approaches</h5><p>Despite their differences, the insights of the practitioners of both structuralism and functionalism created an intellectual context in which contemporary psychology could flourish. Psychologists currently examine both the structure and the function of behavior.</p>
<h5 id="Women-as-Pioneering-Researchers"><a href="#Women-as-Pioneering-Researchers" class="headerlink" title="Women as Pioneering Researchers"></a>Women as Pioneering Researchers</h5><p>Since the days in which these women were pioneers, the field of psychology has changed in the direction of far greater diversity. In fact, in recent years more women than men have earned PhDs in the field (National Science Foundation, 2010). I will highlight the work of diverse researchers throughout Psychology and Life. As psychology continues to contribute to the scientific and human enterprise, more people—women and men, and members of all segments of society—are being drawn to its richness.</p>
<h5 id="Perspectives-on-Psychology"><a href="#Perspectives-on-Psychology" class="headerlink" title="Perspectives on Psychology"></a>Perspectives on Psychology</h5><p>In a similar fashion, psychologists’ perspectives determine the way in which they examine behavior and mental processes. The perspectives influence what psychologists look for, where they look, and what research methods they use. This section defines seven perspectives—psychodynamic, behaviorist, humanistic, cognitive, biological, evolutionary, and sociocultural. As you read the section, note how each perspective defines the causes and consequences of behavior.</p>
<h6 id="The-Psychodynamic-Perspective"><a href="#The-Psychodynamic-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="The Psychodynamic Perspective"></a>The Psychodynamic Perspective</h6><p>According to the psychodynamic perspective, behavior is driven, or motivated, by powerful inner forces. In this view, human actions stem from inherited instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and society’s demands. Deprivation states, physiological arousal, and conflicts provide the power for behavior. According to this model, the organism stops reacting when its needs are satisfied and its drives reduced. The main purpose of action is to reduce tension.         </p>
<p>Freud’s ideas grew out of his work with mentally disturbed patients, but he believed that the principles he observed applied to both normal and abnormal behavior. Freud’s psychodynamic theory views a person as pulled and pushed by a complex network of inner and outer forces. Freud’s model was the first to recognize that human nature is not always rational and that actions may be driven by motives that are not in conscious awareness.     </p>
<p>Freud himself emphasized early childhood as the stage in which personality is formed. Neo-Freudian theorists have broadened psychodynamic theory to include social influences and interactions that occur over the individual’s entire lifetime.           </p>
<p>psychodynamic perspective: A psychological model in which behavior is explained in terms of past experiences and motivational forces; actions are viewed as stemming from inherited instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and social requirements. </p>
<h6 id="The-Behaviorist-Perspective"><a href="#The-Behaviorist-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="The Behaviorist Perspective"></a>The Behaviorist Perspective</h6><p>Those who take the behaviorist perspective seek to understand how particular environmental stimuli control particular kinds of behavior. First, behaviorists analyze the antecedent environmental conditions—those that precede the behavior and set the stage for an organism to make a response or withhold a response. Next, they look at the behavioral response, which is the main object of study—the action to be understood, predicted, and controlled. Finally, they examine the observable consequences that follow from the response.           </p>
<p>Behaviorism has yielded a critical practical legacy. Its emphasis on the need for rigorous experimentation and carefully defined variables has influenced most areas of psychology. Although behaviorists have conducted much basic research with nonhuman animals, the principles of behaviorism have been widely applied to human problems.         </p>
<h6 id="The-Cognitive-Perspective"><a href="#The-Cognitive-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="The Cognitive Perspective"></a>The Cognitive Perspective</h6><p>behaviorist perspective: The psychological perspective primarily concerned with observable behavior that can be objectively recorded and with the relationships of  observable behavior to environmental stimuli. behaviorism A scientific approach that limits the study of psychology to measurable or observable  behavior.<br>humanistic perspective: A psychological model that emphasizes an individual’s phenomenal world and  inherent capacity for making rational choices and developing to maximum potential. </p>
<p>cognitive perspective: The perspective on psychology that stresses human thought and the processes  of knowing, such as attending, thinking, remembering, expecting, solving problems, fantasizing, and  consciousness. </p>
<p>The cognitive revolution in psychology emerged as another challenge to the limits of behaviorism. The centerpiece of the cognitive perspective is human thought and all the processes of knowing—attending, thinking, remembering, and understanding. From the cognitive perspective, people act because they think, and people think because they are human beings, exquisitely equipped to do so. According to the cognitive model, behavior is only partly determined by preceding environmental events and past behavioral consequences, as behaviorists believe. Some of the most significant behavior emerges from totally novel ways of thinking, not from predictable ways used in the past.</p>
<p>Cognitive psychologists study higher mental processes such as perception, memory, language use, thinking, problem solving, and decision making at a variety of levels. Cognitive psychologists view thoughts as both results and causes of overt actions         </p>
<p>Within the cognitive perspective, an individual responds to reality not as it is in the objective world of matter but as it is in the subjective reality of the individual’s inner world of thoughts and imagination. Because of its focus on mental processes, many researchers see the cognitive perspective as the dominant approach in psychology today</p>
<h6 id="The-Biological-Perspective"><a href="#The-Biological-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="The Biological Perspective"></a>The Biological Perspective</h6><p>The biological perspective guides psychologists who search for the causes of behavior in the functioning of genes, the brain, the nervous system, and the endocrine system. An organism’s functioning is explained in terms of underlying physical structures and biochemical processes. Experience and behaviors are largely understood as the result of chemical and electrical activities taking place within and between nerve cells.          </p>
<p>Researchers who take the biological perspective generally assume that psychological and social phenomena can be ultimately understood in terms of biochemical processes: Even the most complex phenomena can be understood by analysis, or reduction, into ever smaller, more specific units. Experience can modify behavior by altering these underlying biological structures and processes.</p>
<p>biological perspective: The approach to identifying causes of behavior that focuses on the functioning of genes, the brain, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.      </p>
<p>behavioral neuroscience: A multidisciplinary field that attempts to understand the brain processes that underlie behavior. cognitive neuroscience A multidisciplinary field that attempts to understand the brain processes that underlie higher cognitive functions in humans.        </p>
<p>evolutionary perspective: The approach to psychology that stresses the importance of behavioral and mental adaptiveness, based on the assumption that mental capabilities evolved over millions of years to serve particular adaptive purposes.</p>
<h6 id="The-Evolutionary-Perspective"><a href="#The-Evolutionary-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="The Evolutionary Perspective"></a>The Evolutionary Perspective</h6><p>The evolutionary perspective seeks to connect contemporary psychology to a central idea of the life sciences, Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. The idea of natural selection is quite simple:Those organisms that are better suited to their environments tend to produce offspring (and pass on their genes) more successfully than those organisms with poorer adaptations. Over many generations, the species changes in the direction of the privileged adaptation. The evolutionary perspective in psychology suggests that mental abilities evolved over millions of years to serve particular adaptive purposes, just as physical abilities did.        </p>
<p>To practice evolutionary psychology, researchers focus on the environmental conditions in which the human brain evolved. Humans spent 99 percent of their evolutionary history as hunter–gatherers living in small groups during the Pleistocene era (the roughly 2-million-year period ending 10,000 years ago). Evolutionary psychology uses the rich theoretical framework of evolutionary biology to identify the central adaptive problems that faced this species: avoiding predators and parasites, gathering and exchanging food, finding and retaining mates, and raising healthy children. After identifying the adaptive problems that these early humans faced, evolutionary psychologists generate inferences about the sorts of mental mechanisms, or psychological adaptations, that might have evolved to solve those problems.    </p>
<h6 id="The-Sociocultural-Perspective"><a href="#The-Sociocultural-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="The Sociocultural Perspective"></a>The Sociocultural Perspective</h6><p>Psychologists who take a sociocultural perspective study cross-cultural differences in the causes and consequences of behavior. The sociocultural perspective is an important response to the criticism that psychological research has too often been based on a Western conception of human nature and had as its subject population mostly white middle-class Americans (Arnett, 2008; Gergen et al., 1996). A proper consideration of cultural forces may involve comparisons of groups within the same national boundaries. For example, researchers may look within the United States to compare the prevalence of eating disorders for women of different races (see Chapter 11). Cultural forces may also be assessed across nationalities, as in comparisons of media reports in the United States and Japan (see Chapter 16). Cross-cultural psychologists want to determine whether the theories researchers have developed apply to all humans, or only to more narrow, specific populations.</p>
<p>The sociocultural perspective, therefore, suggests that some universal claims of the psychodynamic perspective are incorrect.</p>
<p>sociocultural perspective: The psychological perspective that focuses on cross-cultural differences in the causes and consequences of behavior.</p>
<h6 id="Comparing-Perspectives-Focus-on-Aggression"><a href="#Comparing-Perspectives-Focus-on-Aggression" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Perspectives: Focus on Aggression"></a>Comparing Perspectives: Focus on Aggression</h6><p>Psychodynamic. Analyze aggression as a reaction to frustrations caused by barriers to pleasure, such as unjust authority. View aggression as an adult’s displacement of hostility originally felt as a child against his or her parents.</p>
<p>Behaviorist. Identify reinforcements of past aggressive responses, such as extra attention given to a child who hits classmates or siblings. Assert that children learn from physically abusive parents to be abusive with their own children. </p>
<p>Humanistic. Look for personal values and social conditions that foster self-limiting, aggressive perspectives instead of growth-enhancing, shared experiences. </p>
<p>Cognitive. Explore the hostile thoughts and fantasies people experience while witnessing violent acts, noting both aggressive imagery and intentions to harm others. Study the impact of violence in films and videos, including pornographic violence, on attitudes toward gun control, rape, and war. </p>
<p>Biological. Study the role of specific brain systems in aggression by stimulating different regions and then recording any destructive actions that are elicited. Also analyze the brains of mass murderers for abnormalities; examine female aggression as related to phases of the menstrual cycle. </p>
<p>Evolutionary. Consider what conditions would have made aggression an adaptive behavior for early humans. Identify psychological mechanisms capable of selectively generating aggressive behavior under those conditions. </p>
<p>Sociocultural. Consider how members of different cultures display and interpret aggression. Identify how cultural forces affect the likelihood of different types of aggressive behavior.</p>

<li>Set aside sufficient time for your reading assignments and review of class notes. This text contains much new technical information, many principles to learn, and a new glossary of terms to memorize. To master this material, you will need at least three hours of reading time per chapter. </li>
<li>Keep a record of your study time for this course. Plot the number of hours (in half-hour intervals) you study at each reading session. Chart your time investment on a cumulative graph. Add each new study time to the previous total on the left-hand axis of the graph and each study session on the baseline axis. The chart will provide visual feedback of your progress and show you when you have not been hitting the books as you should. </li>
<li>Be an active participant. Optimal learning occurs when you are actively involved with the learning materials. That means reading attentively, listening to lectures mindfully,paraphrasing in your own words what you are reading or hearing, and taking good notes. In the text, underline key sections, write notes to yourself in the margins, and summarize points that you think might be included on class tests. </li>
<li>Space out your studying. Research in psychology tells us that it is more effective to do your studying regularly rather than cramming just before tests. If you let yourself fall behind, it will be difficult to catch up with all the information included in introductory psychology at lastminute panic time. </li>
<li>Get study-centered. Find a place with minimal distractions for studying. Reserve that place for studying, reading, and writing course assignments—and do nothing else there. The place will come to be associated with study activities, and you will find it easier to work whenever you are seated at your study center.</li>

<h4 id="Study-Techniques"><a href="#Study-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Study Techniques"></a>Study Techniques</h4><p>PQ4R: Preview, Question,Read, Reflect, Recite, and Review </p>
<ol>
<li>Preview. Skim through the chapter to get a general sense of the topics the chapter will discuss. Make yourself aware of the organization and major topics. Read the section headings and scan the photos and figures. In fact, your first stop for each chapter should be the section “Recapping Main Points.” There you will find the main ideas of the chapter organized under each of the first-level headings, which will give you a clear sense of what the chapter covers.</li>
<li>Question. For each section, make up questions. You should use the section headings and key terms to help you. For example, you might transform the heading “The Goals of Psychology” into the question “What are the goals of psychology?” You might use the key term biological perspective to generate the question, “What is the major focus of the biological perspective?” These questions will help direct your attention as you read. </li>
<li>Read. Read the material carefully so that you are able to answer the questions you invented. </li>
<li>Reflect. As you read the text, reflect on it to relate the material to your prior knowledge about the topics. Think of extra examples to enrich the text. Try to link the ideas together across the subsections. </li>
<li>Recite. After you have read and reflected on a section, try to demonstrate your recall of the material as concretely as possible. For example, answer the questions you invented earlier by producing the material out loud. For later review, write down the ideas you find difficult to remember. </li>
<li>Review. After you have read the entire chapter, review the key points. If you are unable to recall important points, or you cannot answer the questions you invented, consult the book and repeat the earlier phases (read, reflect, and recite).</li>

</ol>
<p>A theory is an organized set of concepts that explains a phenomenon or set of phenomena. </p>
<p>At the common core of most psychological theories is the assumption of determinism, the idea that all events—physical, mental,and behavioral—are the result of, or determined by, specificcausal factors. These causal factors are limited to those in the individual’s environment or within the person.</p>
<p>A hypothesis is a tentative and testable statement about the relationship between causes and consequences.</p>
<p>This research process is centered around appropriate uses of the scientific method. The goal of the scientific method is to allow researchers to draw conclusions with maximum objectivity. </p>
<p>theory: An organized set of concepts that explains a phenomenon or set of phenomena.</p>
<p>determinism: The doctrine that all events—physical, behavioral, and mental—are determined by specific causal factors that are potentially knowable.</p>
<h5 id="Observer-Biases-and-Operational"><a href="#Observer-Biases-and-Operational" class="headerlink" title="Observer Biases and Operational"></a>Observer Biases and Operational</h5><p>An observer bias is an error due to the personal motives and expectations of the viewer. At times, people see and hear what they expect rather than what is</p>
<p>hypothesis: A tentative and testable explanation of the relationship between two (or more) events or variables; often stated as a prediction that a certain outcome will result from specific conditions.</p>
<p>observer bias: The distortion of evidence because of the personal motives and expectations of the viewer.</p>
<p>The biases of the observers act as filters through which some things are noticed as relevant and significant and others are ignored as irrelevant and not meaningful.</p>
<p>To minimize observer biases, researchers rely on standardization and operational definitions. Standardization means using uniform, consistent procedures in all phases of data collection.</p>
<p>The strategy for standardizing the meaning of concepts is called operationalization. An operational definition standardizes meaning within an experiment, by defining a concept in terms of specific operations or procedures used to measure it or to determine its presence. All the variables in an experiment must be given operational definitions.</p>
<p>A variable is any factor that varies in amount or kind.</p>
<p>the hypothesis we considered earlier: that children who view a lot of violence on television will engage in more aggressive acts toward their peers. To test that hypothesis, you might devise an experiment in which you manipulated the amount of violence each participant viewed. That factor you manipulate would be the independent variable; it functions as the causal part of the relationship. For each level of violence viewed, you could then assess how much aggression each participant displayed. Aggression is the effect part of the causeeffect relationship; it is the dependent variable, which is what the experimenter measures. </p>
<p>standardization: A set of uniform procedures for treating each<br>participant in a test, interview, or experiment, or for recording data.</p>
<p>operational definition: A definition of a variable or condition in terms of<br>the specific operation or procedure used to determine its presence.</p>
<p>variable: In an experimental setting, a factor that varies in amount<br>and kind.</p>
<p>independent variable: In an experimental setting, a variable that the<br>researcher manipulates with the expectation of having an impact on<br>values of the dependent variable.</p>
<p>dependent variable: In an experimental setting, a variable that the<br>researcher measures to assess the impact of a variation in an<br>independent variable.</p>
<h4 id="Definitions-Experimental-Methods-Alternative-Explanations-and-the-Need-for-Controls-Correlational-Methods"><a href="#Definitions-Experimental-Methods-Alternative-Explanations-and-the-Need-for-Controls-Correlational-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Definitions Experimental Methods: Alternative Explanations and the Need for Controls Correlational Methods"></a>Definitions Experimental Methods: Alternative Explanations and the Need for Controls Correlational Methods</h4><p>To overcome causal ambiguity, researchers use experimental methods: They manipulate an independent variable to look for an effect on a dependent variable. The goal of this method is to make strong causal claims about the impact of one variable on the other. </p>
<p>experimental method: Research methodology that involves the manipulation of independent variables to determine their effects on the dependent variables.</p>
<h5 id="The-Challenge-to-Objectivity"><a href="#The-Challenge-to-Objectivity" class="headerlink" title="The Challenge to Objectivity"></a>The Challenge to Objectivity</h5><p>For example, you might predict, and demonstrate experimentally, that the viewing of television violence leads to high levels of aggression. But how can you know that it was precisely the viewing of violence that produced aggression? To make the strongest possible case for their hypotheses, psychologists must be very sensitive to the existence of possible alternative explanations.</p>
<p>When something other than what an experimenter purposely introduces into a research setting changes a participant’s behavior and adds confusion to the interpretation of the data, it is called a <strong>confounding variable</strong>. </p>
<p>Unintentional <strong>expectancy effects</strong> occur when a researcher or observer subtly communicates to the research participants the behaviors he or she expects to find, thereby producing the desired reaction. Under these circumstances, the experimenter’s expectations, rather than the independent variable, actually help trigger the observed reactions.</p>
<p>A <strong>placebo effect</strong> occurs when experimental participants change their behavior in the absence of any kind of experimental manipulation. This concept originated in medicine to account for cases in which a patient’s health improved after he or she had received medication that was chemically inert or a treatment that was nonspecific. The placebo effect refers to an improvement in health or well-being related to the individual’s belief that the treatment will be effective. </p>
<p>confounding variable: A stimulus other than the variable an experimenter explicitly introduces into a research setting that affects a participant’s behavior.</p>
<p>expectancy effect: Result that occurs when a researcher or observer subtly communicates to participants the kind of behavior he or she expects to find, hereby creating that expected reaction.</p>
<p>placebo effect: A change in behavior in the absence of an experimental manipulation. </p>
<p>control procedure: Consistent procedure for giving instructions, scoring responses, and holding all other variables constant except those being systematically varied.</p>
<h5 id="The-Remedy-Control-Procedures"><a href="#The-Remedy-Control-Procedures" class="headerlink" title="The Remedy: Control Procedures"></a>The Remedy: Control Procedures</h5><p>Researchers’ strategies are called control procedures—methods that attempt to hold constant all variables and conditions other than those related to the hypothesis being tested. In an experiment, instructions, room temperature, tasks, the way the researcher is dressed, time allotted, the way the responses are recorded, and many other details of the situation must be similar for all participants, to ensure that their experience is the same. The only differences in participants’ experiences should be those introduced by the independent variable. Let’s look at remedies for the specific confounding variables, expectancy and placebo effects.</p>
<p>Thus, in your experiment, we would want the research assistant who greeted the participants and later assessed their aggression to be unaware of whether they had watched a violent program or a comedy: We would keep the research assistant blind to the assignment of participants to conditions. In the best circumstances, bias can be eliminated by keeping both experimental assistants and participants blind to which aparticipants get which treatment. This technique is called a <strong>double-blind control</strong>. In our prospective aggression experiment, we couldn’t keep participants from knowing whether they had watched comedy or violence. However, we would take great care to ensure that they couldn’t guess that our later analyses would focus on their subsequent aggression.</p>
<p>To account for placebo effects, researchers generally include an experimental condition in which the treatment is not administered. This is a <strong>placebo control</strong>. Placebo controls fall into the general category of controls by which experimenters assure themselves they are making appropriate comparisons. On one task, people were asked to view a series of 20 pictures on a computer screen, name them, and later recall those names. The participants were 14 percent better at this task after six weeks of ginkgo. However, participants who took a placebo—a pill with no active ingredients—also improved by 14 percent. The placebo control suggests that improvement on the task was the result of practice from the initial session. The data from control conditions provide an important baseline against which the experimental effect is evaluated</p>
<h5 id="The-Remedy-Research-Designs"><a href="#The-Remedy-Research-Designs" class="headerlink" title="The Remedy: Research Designs"></a>The Remedy: Research Designs</h5><p>To implement control conditions, researchers make decisions about what type of research design best suits their goals. In some research designs, which are referred to as between-subjects designs, different groups of participants are randomly assigned, by chance procedures, to an experimental condition (exposed to one or more experimental treatments) or to a control condition (not exposed to an experimental treatment). </p>
<p>Random assignment is one of the major steps researchers take to eliminate confounding variables that relate to individual differences among potential research participants. This is the procedure you’d want to use for the aggression experiment. The random assignment to experimental and control conditions makes it quite likely that the two groups will be similar in important ways at the start of an experiment because each participant has the same probability of being in a treatment condition as in a control condition. We shouldn’t have to worry, for example, that everyone in the experimental group loves violent television and everyone in the control group hates it. Random assignment should mix both types of people together in each group. If outcome differences are found between conditions, we can be more confident that the differences were caused by a treatment or intervention rather than by preexisting differences.</p>
<p>double-blind control: An experimental technique in which biased expectations of experimenters are eliminated by keeping both participants and experimental assistants unaware of which participants have received which treatment.</p>
<p>placebo control: An experimental condition in which treatment is not administered; it is used in cases where a placebo effect might occur. between-subjects design A research design in which different groups of participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions or to control conditions.</p>
<p>random assignment: A procedure by which participants have an equal likelihood of being assigned to any condition within an experiment. experimental group A group in an experiment that is exposed to a treatment or experiences a manipulation of the independent variable.</p>
<p>control group: A group in an experiment that is not exposed to a treatment or does not experience a manipulation of the independent variable.</p>
<p>population: The entire set of individuals to which generalizations will be made based on an experimental sample. sample A subset of a population selected as participants in an experiment.</p>
<p>representative sample: A subset of a population that closely matches the overall characteristics of the population with respect to the distribution of males and females, racial and ethnic groups, and so on.</p>
<p>random sampling: A procedure that ensures that every member of a population has an equal likelihood of participating in an experiment. Featured Study</p>
<p>within-subjects design: A research design that uses each participant as his or her own control; for example, the behavior of an experimental participant before receiving treatment might be compared to his or her behavior after receiving treatment.</p>
<p>First, during an experiment, behavior is frequently studied in an artificial environment, one in which situational factors are controlled so heavily that the environment may itself distort the behavior from the way it would occur naturally. Critics claim that much of the richness and complexity of natural behavior patterns is lost in controlled experiments, sacrificed to the simplicity of dealing with only one or a few variables and responses. Second, research participants typically know they are in an experiment and are being tested and measured. They may react to this awareness by trying to please the researcher, attempting to “psych out” the research purpose, or changing their behavior from what it would be if they were unaware of being monitored. Third, some important research problems are not amenable to ethical experimental treatment</p>
<h4 id="Correlational-Methods"><a href="#Correlational-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Correlational Methods"></a>Correlational Methods</h4><p>These questions involve variables that a psychologist could not easily or ethically manipulate. To answer these questions, researchers carry out studies using correlational methods. Psychologists use correlational methods when they want to determine to what extent two variables, traits, or attributes are related</p>
<p>To determine the precise degree of correlation that exists between two variables, psychologists compute a statistical measure known as the correlation coefficient (r). This value can vary between 1.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation, 1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0.0 indicates no correlation at all</p>
<p>correlational method: Research methodology that determines to what extent two variables, traits, or attributes are related.</p>
<p>correlation coefficient: (r) A statistic that indicates the degree of relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>A strong correlation indicates only that two sets of data are related in a systematic way; the correlation does not ensure that one causes the other. Correlation does not imply causation. The correlation could reflect any one of several cause-and-effect possibilities. Many of those possibilities involve a third variable that works in the background to bring about the correlation. </p>
<h3 id="PSYCHOLOGICAL-MEASUREMENT-28"><a href="#PSYCHOLOGICAL-MEASUREMENT-28" class="headerlink" title="PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 28"></a>PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 28</h3><p>Although some actions and processes are easily seen, many, such as anxiety or dreaming, are not. Thus one task for apsychological researcher is to make the unseen visible, to make internal events and processes external, and to make private experiences public. You have already seen how important it is for researchers to provide operational definitions of the phenomena they wish to study. Those definitions generally provide some procedure for assigning numbers to, or quantifying, different levels, sizes, intensities, or amounts of a variable. Many measurement methods are available, each with its particular advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h4 id="Achieving-Reliability-and-Validity"><a href="#Achieving-Reliability-and-Validity" class="headerlink" title="Achieving Reliability and Validity"></a>Achieving Reliability and Validity</h4><p>Reliability refers to the consistency or dependability of behavioral data resulting from psychological testing or experimental research. A reliable result is one that will be repeated under similar conditions of testing at different times.</p>
<p>Validity means that the information produced by research or testing accurately measures the psychological variable or quality it is intended to measure. </p>
<h5 id="Self-Report-Measures"><a href="#Self-Report-Measures" class="headerlink" title="Self-Report Measures"></a>Self-Report Measures</h5><p>Often researchers are interested in obtaining data about experiences they cannot directly observe. Sometimes these experiences are internal psychological states, such as beliefs, attitudes, and feelings. At other times, these experiences are external behaviors but—like sexual activities or criminal acts— not generally appropriate for psychologists to witness. In these cases, investigations rely on self-reports. Self-report measures are verbal answers, either written or spoken, to questions the researcher poses. Researchers devise reliable ways to quantify these self-reports so they can make meaningful comparisons between different individuals’ responses.</p>
<p>reliability: The degree to which a test produces similar scores each time it is used; stability or consistency of the scores produced by an instrument.</p>
<p>validity: The extent to which a test measures what it was intended to measure.</p>
<p>self-report: measure A self-behavior that is identified through a participant’s own observations and reports.</p>
<p>behavioral: measure Overt actions or reaction that is observed and recorded, exclusive of self-reported behavior</p>
<h4 id="Self-Report-Measures-Behavioral-Measures-and-Observations"><a href="#Self-Report-Measures-Behavioral-Measures-and-Observations" class="headerlink" title="Self-Report: Measures Behavioral Measures and Observations"></a>Self-Report: Measures Behavioral Measures and Observations</h4><p>Behavioral measures are ways to study overt actions and observable and recordable reactions.</p>
<p>naturalistic observation:  A research technique in which unobtrusive observations are made of behaviors that occur in natural environments.</p>
<p>case study: Intensive observation of a particular individual or small group of individuals.</p>

They are informed about the procedures they will experience as well as the potential risks and benefits of participation. Given that information, participants are asked to sign a statement indicating that they consent to continue. a</p>
<h4 id="Risk-Gain-Assessment-Intentional"><a href="#Risk-Gain-Assessment-Intentional" class="headerlink" title="Risk/Gain Assessment Intentional"></a>Risk/Gain Assessment Intentional</h4><p>Therefore, whenever a researcher conducts such a study, risks must be minimized, participants must be informed of the risks, and suitable<br>precautions must be taken to deal with strong reactions. </p>

Each animal researcher must judge his or her work with heightened scrutiny</p>
<p>informed consent: The process through which individuals are informed about experimental procedures, risks, and benefits before they provide formal consent to become research participants.</p>
<p>debriefing: A procedure conducted at the end of an experiment in which the researcher provides the participant with as much information about the study as possible and makes sure that no participant leaves feeling confused, upset, or embarrassed.</p>

<p>Studying psychology will help you make wiser decisions based on scientific evidence. Always try to apply the insights you derive from your formal study of psychology to the informal psychology that surrounds you: Ask questions about your own behavior or that of other people, seek answers to these questions with respect to rational psychological theories, and check out the answers against the evidence available to you.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some general rules to keep in mind to be a more sophisticated shopper as you travel through the supermarket of knowledge:</strong></p>
<p>Avoid the inference that correlation is causation.</p>
<p>Ask that critical terms and key concepts be defined operationally so that there can be consensus about their meanings.</p>
<p>Consider first how to disprove a theory, hypothesis, or belief before seeking confirming evidence, which is easy to find when you’re looking for a justification.</p>
<p>Always search for alternative explanations to the obvious ones proposed, especially when the explanations benefit the proposer.</p>
<p>Recognize how personal biases can distort perceptions of reality.</p>
<p>Be suspicious of simple answers to complex questions or single causes and cures for complex effects and problems.</p>
<p>Question any statement about the effectiveness of some treatment, intervention, or product by finding the comparative basis for the effect: compared to what?</p>
<p>Be open-minded yet skeptical: Recognize that most conclusions are tentative and not certain; seek new evidence that decreases your uncertainty while keeping yourself open to change and revision.</p>
<p>Challenge authority that uses personal opinion in place of evidence for conclusions and is not open to constructive criticism.</p>

<p>To test their ideas, researchers use the scientific method, a set of procedures for gathering and interpreting evidence in ways that limit errors.</p>
<p>Researchers combat observer biases by standardizing procedures and using operational definitions.</p>
<p>Experimental research methods determine whether causal relationships exist between variables specified by the hypothesis being tested.</p>
<p>Researchers rule out alternative explanations by using appropriate control procedures.</p>

<h2 id="Statistical-Supplement"><a href="#Statistical-Supplement" class="headerlink" title="Statistical Supplement"></a>Statistical Supplement</h2><p>Understanding Statistics: Analyzing Data and Forming Conclusions</p>
<p>As Chapter 2 noted, psychologists use statistics to make sense of the data they collect. They also use statistics to provide a quantitative basis for the conclusions they draw. </p>
<p>Descriptive statistics use mathematical procedures in an objective, uniform way to describe different aspects of numerical data. </p>
<p>Inferential statistics use probability theory to make sound decisions about which results might have occurred simply through chance variation.</p>
<p>descriptive statistics: Statistical procedures that are used to summarize sets of scores with respect to central tendencies, variability, and correlations. </p>

(It is located in the center of the distribution, and other scores tend to cluster around it.) Typically, psychologists use three different measures of central tendency: the mode, the median, and the mean.</p>
<p>measure of central tendency: A statistic, such as a mean, median, or mode, that provides one score as representative of a set of<br>observations.</p>
<p>mode: The score appearing most frequently in a set of observations; a measure of central tendency.</p>
<p>median: The score in a distribution above and below which lie 50 percent of the other scores; a measure of central tendency.</p>
<p>mean: The arithmetic average of a group of scores; the most commonly used measure of central tendency.</p>
<p>Variability</p>
<p>Measures of variability are statistics that describe the distribution of scores around some measure of central tendency.</p>
<p>The simplest measure of variability is the range, the difference between the highest and the lowest values in a frequency distribution.</p>
<p>standard deviation</p>
<p>measure of variability: A statistic, such as a range or standard deviation,<br>that indicates how tightly the scores in a set of observations cluster<br>together.</p>
<p>range: The difference between the highest and the lowest scores in a set<br>of observations; the simplest measure of variability.</p>
<p>standard deviation (SD): The average difference of a set of scores from<br>their mean; a measure of variability.</p>
<h3 id="Inferential-Statistics"><a href="#Inferential-Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Inferential Statistics"></a>Inferential Statistics</h3><p>Inferential statistics are used to answer these kinds of questions. They tell us which inferences we can make from our samples and which conclusions we can legitimately draw from our data. Inferential statistics use probability theory to determine the likelihood that a set of data occurred simply by chance variation.</p>

<p>normal curve： The symmetrical curve that represents the distribution of<br>scores on many psychological attributes; allows researchers to make<br>judgments of how unusual an observation or result is.</p>
<p>By common agreement, psychologists accept a difference as “real” when the probability that it might be due to chance is less than 5 in 100 (indicated by the notation p  .05). A significant difference is one that meets this criterion. </p>
<p>the t-test, which may be used when an investigator wants to know if the difference between the means of two groups is statistically significant.</p>
<p>significant difference: A difference between experimental groupsor conditions that would have occurred by chance less than an accepted criterion; in psychology, the criterion most often used is a probability of less than 5 times out of 100, or p  .05.</p>
<h3 id="BECOMING-A-WISE-CONSUMER-OF-STATISTICS"><a href="#BECOMING-A-WISE-CONSUMER-OF-STATISTICS" class="headerlink" title="BECOMING A WISE CONSUMER OF STATISTICS"></a>BECOMING A WISE CONSUMER OF STATISTICS</h3><p>There are many ways to give a misleading impression using statistics. The decisions made at all stages of research— from who the participants are to how the study is designed, what statistics are selected, and how they are used—can have a profound effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.</p>
<p>The group of participants can make a large difference that can easily remain undetected when the results are reported.</p>
<p>Even if the participants are randomly selected and not biased by the methodology, the statistics can produce misleading results if the assumptions of the statistics are violated</p>
<p>One good way to avoid falling for this sort of deception is to check on the size of the sample. Large samples are less likely to be misleading than small ones. Another check is to look at the median or the mode as well as the mean. </p>
